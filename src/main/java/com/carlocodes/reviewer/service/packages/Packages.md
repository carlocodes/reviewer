# Packages

In Java, packages are a way to organize and manage classes and interfaces into a hierarchical
structure. They help you avoid naming conflicts and provide a logical grouping for related
classes. It is a directory or folder that contains Java source files (`'.java'`) and compile
bytecode files (`'.class'`).

The main purposes of using packages are:

1. Organization
Packages help organize your code by grouping classes and interfaces that serve a similar
purpose or belong to a common module or component.

2. Access Control
Packages provide access control, meaning you can control the visibility of classes and
interfaces by using the `'public`, `'protected'`, `'default'` (no modifier), and `'private'`
access modifiers. Classes in the same package can access package-private members of other
classes.

3. Avoid Naming Conflicts:
Packages prevent naming conflicts by allowing classes with the same name to coexist if they
are in different packages.

To define a package in Java, you include a package declaration at the top of your source code
file. For example:
```
package com.example.myapp;
```

How to use packages:

1. Package Declaration
As mentioned earlier, you declare the package at the beginning of your Java source files. This
associates the classes in that file with the specified package.

2. Import Statements
To use classes from other packages, you can use import statements. For example:
```
import com.example.myapp.SomeClass;
```

This allows you to use `'SomeClass'` from the `'com.example.myapp'` package in your code.

1. Class and Package hierarchy
Packages can be organized in a hierarchical structure, which mirrors the directory structure.
For example, you can have sub-packages inside a package. Classes in sub-packages can be accessed
with their full package path.

2. Access Modifiers
The visibility of classes, fields, and methods can be controlled using access modifiers like
`'public'`, `'protected'`, `'default'`, and `'private'`. The default visibility (no modifier)
makes members visible only within the same package.

When to use packages:

You should use packages in the following scenarios:

1. Organization
Use packages to organize your codebase. Group related classes and interfaces into packages
to make your project structure more maintainable.

2. Avoid conflicts
Use packages to avoid naming conflicts. If you have classes with the same name in different
parts of your project, place them in separate packages.

3. Access control
Utilize packages to control access to classes and members. You can make certain classes or
members package-private to restrict access to only classes within the same package.

You may use packages extensively to organize your codebase, manage dependencies, and ensure
the security and integrity of your financial software applications. This is crucial in
maintaining a well-structured and maintainable codebase for your projects.
