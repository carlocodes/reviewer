# Set

In Java, the `'Set'` interface is part of the Java Collections Framework
and represents a collection of unique elements. It ensures that each
element in the set is distinct, marking it useful for scenarios where
you need to store a collection of items without duplicates.

There are several implementations of the `'Set'` interface in Java,
each with its characteristics and use cases. Let's explore each
implementation with examples and use cases:

1. **HashSet:**
   - **Implementation:** `'HashSet'` is a hash table-based
   implementation of the `'Set'` interface. It provides constant-time
   performance for basic operations (add, remove, contains).

Example:
```
Set<String> hashSet = new HashSet<>();
hashSet.add("Alice");
hashSet.add("Bob");
hashSet.add("Charlie);
```

Use cases:
- When you need a collection of unique elements and don't require any
specific order.
- For general-purpose unique element storage.

2. **TreeSet:**
   - **Implementation:** `'TreeSet'` is a sorted implementation of the
   `'Set'` interface that stores elements in a natural order or using
   a custom comparator.

Example:
```
Set<String> treeSet = new TreeSet<>();
treeSet.add("Alice");
treeSet.add("Bob");
treeSet.add("Charlie");
```

Use cases:
- When you need a sorted collection of unique elements.
- For scenarios where you require elements to be in a specific order.

3. **LinkedHashSet:**
   - **Implementation:** `'LinkedHashSet'` is similar to `'HashSet'`,
   but maintains the order of elements based on insertion order.

Example:
```
Set<String> linkedHashSet = new LinkedHashSet<>();
linkedHashSet.add("Alice");
linkedHashSet.add("Bob");
linkedHashSet.add("Charlie");
```

Use cases:
- Specifically for working with enum values.
- For scenarios where you need to efficiently manage a set of enum
constants.

4. **ConcurrentSkipListSet:**
   - **Implementation:** `'ConcurrentSkipListSet'` is a thread-safe
   implementation of the `'Set'` interface that maintains elements in
   sorted order. It is concurrent and performs well in multithreaded
   environments.

Example:
```
Set<String> concurrentSkipListSet = new ConcurrentSkipListSet<>();
concurrentSkipListSet.add("Alice");
concurrentSkipListSet.add("Bob");
concurrentSkipListSet.add("Charlie");
```

Use cases:
- When you need a thread-safe, sorted collection of unique elements
with good concurrency performance.
- For scenarios where multi threads read and write to the set
concurrently.

Each implementation of the `'Set'` interface has its own advantages
and use cases. When choosing the appropriate implementation, consider
factors like element uniqueness, order, thread safety, and performance
requirements specific to your use case.
