# URI

A URI, or Uniform Resource Identifier, is a string of characters that identifies a specific
resource. It is a superset of the more familiar term URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and
encompasses both URLs and URNs (Uniform Resource Names). URIs provide a means of identifying
and accessing resources on the internet in a standardized way.

There are two main types of URIs:

1. URL (Uniform Resource Locator):
- A URL is a specific type of URI that provides the means to locate and retrieve a resource on
the internet. URLs include information about how to access the resource, such as the protocol
to use (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS), the domain or IP address of the server, the path to the resource,
and optional query parameters.
- Example `"https://www.example.com/resource"`

2. URN (Uniform Resource Name):
- A URN is another type of URI that is used to uniquely identify a resource by name in a
particular namespace. Unlike URLs, which specify how to access a resource, URNs are intended
to be persistent identifiers that remain stable over time, even if the resource's location
changes.
- Example: `"urn:isbn:0451450523"`

In summary, while a URL is a type of URI that provides a way to locate and retrieve a resource,
a URI is a more general term that encompasses both URLs and URNs. URIs play a crucial role in
web development, providing a standardized means of identifying and referring to resources on
the internet.
