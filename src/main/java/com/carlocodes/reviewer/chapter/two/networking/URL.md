# URL

A URL, or Uniform Resource Locator, is a reference or address used to access resources on the
internet. It serves as a standardized way to locate and retrieve information over the web. A
URL consists of several components that specify the protocol used, the domain or IP address of
the server, the path to a specific resource, and optional query parameters.

Here's the breakdown of a typical URL:

1. Protocol (Scheme):
- Indicates the protocol used to access the resource. Common examples include "http", "https",
"ftp", and "mailto".
- Example: `"https://www.example.com"`

2. Domain (Host):
- Specifies the domain name or IP address of the server hosting the resource.
- Example: `"https://www.example.com"`

3. Port (Optional):
- If a specific port is used for communication, it follows the domain and is separated by a
colon. The default ports are 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS.
- Example: `"https://www.example.com:8080"`

4. Path:
- Specifies the location of the resource on the server. it starts with a forward slash ("/").
- Example: `"https://www.example.com/path/to/resource"`

5. Query Parameters (Optional):
- Additional parameters that are appended to the URL and provide information to the server.
- Example: `"https://www.example.com/resource?param1=value1&param2=value2"`

6. Fragment (Anchor) (Optional):
- Points to a specific section within the resource, often used in HTML documents.
- Example: `"https://www.example.com/page#section1"`

Putting it all together, a complete url might look like this:
```
https://www.example.com:8080/path/to/resource?param1=value1&param2=value2#section1
```

URLs are used in web browsers, APIs, and various other applications to locate and access web
resources. They place a crucial role in defining the addressing structure of the World Wide Web.
