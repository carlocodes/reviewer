# Multiple JDK Distributions

The existence of multiple JDK distributions arises from the open-source nature of the Java
platform, different licensing considerations, and community efforts to provide alternative
implementation and support. Each JDK distribution has its own characteristics, and the choice
of which one to use may depend on factors such as licensing, support, performance, and specific
features. Let's explore some of the popular JDK distributions:

1. OpenJDK:
OpenJDK is the official reference implementation of the Java platform, Standard Edition (Java
SE). It is open source and maintained by the Java community, with contributions from various
organizations. OpenJDK is often used as the base for other JDK distributions.

2. Oracle JDK:
Oracle JDK, provided by Oracle Corporation, includes additional features and commercial
support. It was historically one of the most commonly used JDKs. Starting from JDK 11, Oracle
JDK uses a new subscription-based model for commercial users, and they provide free versions
for personal and development use.

3. AdoptOpenJDK:
AdoptOpenJDK is a community-driven initiative that provides free and open-source distributions
of OpenJDK. It offers prebuilt binaries for various platforms and is known for timely releases
and community support. It has become a popular choice for developers looking for an alternative
to Oracle JDK.

4. Amazon Corretto:
Amazon Corretto is a no-cost, multiplatform, production-ready distribution of OpenJDK. It
includes long-term support and is designed to be compatible with other JDK distributions. It
is suitable for use in various environments, including AWS services.

5. Azul Zulu:
Zulu, provided by Azul Systems, is another distribution of OpenJDK. It is known for its focus
on performance and optimizations. Zulu is available as a free, open-source version, as well as
commercially supported editions.

### Differences among JDK distributions:

1. Licensing:
Different JDK distributions may have different licensing models. For example, Oracle JDK has a
new subscription-based model for commercial use, while many others, like OpenJDK, AdoptOpenJDK,
and Amazon Corretto, offer free and open-source alternatives.

2. Release Cadence:
The release cadence of updates and new versions may vary among distributions. Some may provide
updates more frequently than others. Developers may choose a distribution based on their
preference for stable, long-term support, or access to the latest features.

3. Support and Maintenance:
Commercial distributions like Oracle JDK may come with commercial support, while others rely
on community support. Some distributions, like AdoptOpenJDK and Azul Zulu, offer support plans
for those who need them.

4. Performance Optimization:
Certain distributions, like Azul Zulu, may include performance optimizations and enhancements
beyond the standard OpenJDK. These optimizations can result in improved runtime performance.

### Does it matter which JDK you install?
The choice of JDK distribution depends on your specific needs and considerations:

- Compatibility: For general compatibility and adherence to the Java SE specifications,
OpenJDK is a solid choice.
- Licensing and Support: If you require long-term support and commercial support, you might
consider Oracle JDK (with a subscription) or other commercially supported distributions.
- Community Support: Distributions like AdoptOpenJDK and Amazon Corretto offer community-driven
support and timely updates.
- Performance: If performance is a critical factor, you might explore distributions like Azul
Zulu, which focuses on optimizations.

It's essential to review the licensing terms, support options, and features provided by each
distribution to make an informed decision based on your project requirements and preferences.
Many developers use OpenJDK-based distributions due to their open-source nature and widespread
community support.
