# Garbage Collector Algorithms

Java provides several garbage collection algorithms, each with its characteristics and use
cases. The choice of garbage collection algorithm depends on the factors such as application
requirements, performance goals, and memory characteristics. Here are some of the primary
garbage collection algorithms in Java:

1. Serial Garbage Collector:
- Description:
The Serial Garbage Collector is a simple, single-threaded collector that is suitable for
small-scale applications or those with low memory requirements.

- Usage:
Often used for client-side applications or small server applications where responsiveness is
crucial, and memory footprint is not a significant concern.

- Key Characteristics:
  - Stop-the-world: Application threads are paused during garbage collection.
  - Suitable for single-threaded environments or applications with limited memory.

2. Parallel Garbage Collector:
- Description:
The Parallel Garbage Collector, also known as the throughput collector, utilizes multiple
threads to perform garbage collection in the young generation.

- Usage:
Suited for applications with multicore processors and high-throughput requirements.

- Key Characteristics:
  - Stop-the world: During garbage collection, all application threads are paused.
  - Efficient for applications with large datasets and high-throughput demands.

3. Concurrent Mark-Sweep (CMS) Garbage Collector:
- Description:
The CMS Garbage Collector aims to minimize pause times by performing most of the garbage
collection work concurrently with the application threads.

- Usage:
Suitable for applications where low-latency is a priority, and shorter pause times are
essential.

- Key Characteristics:
  - Low-pause: Attempts to minimize stop-the-world pauses for young generation and concurrent
  collection for the old generation.
  - May not be as efficient for applications with very large heaps.

4. Garbage-First (G1) Garbage Collector:
- Description:
The G1 Garbage Collector is designed for large heaps and aims to provide high throughput
while maintaining low-latency pause times.

- Usage:
Suited for applications with large heaps and a desire for both high throughput and low-latency
pauses.

- Key Characteristics:
  - Region-based: Divides the heap into regions for more predictable pause times.
  - Adaptive: Adjusts the collection strategy based on application behavior.
  - Goal is to replace the CMS collector with improved efficiency.

5. Z Garbage Collector (ZGC):
- Description:
The Z Garbage Collector is designed to minimize pause times and handle very large heaps,
making it suitable for applications requiring low-latency characteristics.

- Usage:
Suited for applications with stringent low-latency requirements and large heaps.

- Key Characteristics:
  - Concurrent: Most of the garbage collection work is done concurrently with application
  threads.
  - Predictable: Aims to provide consistently low pause times.
  - Intended for large heaps (multi-terabyte) with low-latency goals.

6. Shenandoah Garbage Collector:
- Description:
Similar to ZGC, Shenandoah is designed for low-latency and aims to reduce pause times in
large heaps.

- Usage:
Suited for applications with very large heaps and strict low-latency requirements.

- Key Characteristics:
  - Concurrent: Minimizes stop-the-world pauses by performing most work concurrently with
  application threads.
  - Adaptive: Adjusts strategies based on application behavior.
  - Aimed at reducing latency for applications with large heaps.

### Notes:

- The choice of a garbage collector often involves trade-offs between throughput, pause times,
and memory efficiency.
- Java 9 introduced the "G1" collector as the default garbage collector for server-class
machines.
- New garbage collectors like ZGC and Shenandoah are part of the effort to provide better
solutions for low-latency requirements and very large heaps.

The optimal garbage collection strategy depends on teh specific characteristics and
requirements of your Java application. It's essential to monitor and analyze garbage
collection behavior to make informed decisions about which collector best suits your needs.
