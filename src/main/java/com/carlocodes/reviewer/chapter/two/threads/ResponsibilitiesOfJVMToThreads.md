# Responsibilities of the Java Virtual Machine to the Threads

Threads in Java exist within the context of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The JVM is
responsible for creating, managing, and controlling threads. Threads are not entities that
exist independently of the JVM; instead, they are a part of the Java Runtime Environment.

Here's how it works:

1. Thread Creation:
   - You can create threads in Java by extending the `'Thread'` class or implementing the
   `'Runnable'` interface.
   - When you create an instance of a thread and start it using the `'start()'` method, the
   JVM allocates resources for the thread.

2. Thread Management by JVM:
   - The JVM has a built-in thread scheduler that manages the execution of threads.
   - The scheduler determines which thread to execute based on priorities, thread states,
   and other factors.

3. Thread Lifecycle:
   - Threads go through various states such as NEW, RUNNABLE, BLOCKED, WAITING, TIME_WAITING,
   and TERMINATED.
   - The JVM transitions threads between these states based on their activities.

4. Context Switching:
   - When the thread scheduler decides to switch from one thread to another, it performs a
   context switch.
   - The context switch involves saving the current thread's state and restoring the state of
   the next thread to be executed.

5. Thread Termination:
   - When a thread completes its execution or is explicitly terminated, the JVM releases the
   resources associated with that thread.

In summary, threads in Java live within the JVM's runtime environment. The JVM provides the
infrastructure for thread creation, management, and scheduling. The JVM controls execution of
threads, ensuring they run concurrently and efficiently. Thread-related operations, such as
context switching and resource management, are handled by the JVM to enable multithreading in
Java applications.
