# URN

A URN, or Uniform Resource Name, is a specific type of Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that
is used to uniquely identify a resource by name in a particular namespace. Unlike URLs (Uniform
Resource Locators), which provide information on how to access a resource, URNs are designed to
serve as persistent, location-independent identifiers that remain stable over time, even if the
resource's location changes.

Key characteristics of URNs include:

1. Namespace:
- URNs are assigned with specific namespaces, each with its own rules and conventions. These
namespaces are managed to ensure uniqueness and persistence of identifiers.

2. Persistence:
- The primary purpose of URNs is to provide long-term, persistent identification for resources.
Even if the resource is moved to a different location or its access mechanism changes, the URN
should remain the same.

3. Example URN:
- An example URN might look like the following:
```
urn:isbn:0451450523
```
In this case, the URN is using the ISBN (International Standard Book Number) namespace to
uniquely identify a book.

4. Use Cases:
- URNs are commonly used in scenarios where stable, long-term identification is crucial, such
as in academic, library, and archival contexts. They provide a way to reference resources in a
manner that doesn't rely on the resource's location or access mechanism.

It's important to note that while URNs offer persistent identification, the actual retrieval
or access of the resource may still be accomplished using other types of URIs, such as URLs.
URNs and URLs are both subsets of URIs, with URNs emphasizing identification by name and URLs
emphasizing the means of access.
