# Generics

Generics in Java were introduced to provide stronger type-checking at compile time and to
enable generic programming. They allow you to write classes, interfaces, and methods that
operate on parameters of unspecified types. This helps in creating reusable code that is more
type-safe and can work with different types without sacrificing type safety.

### What Generics Do:

1. Type Safety:
Generics provide compile-time type-checking, ensuring that the code is type-safe. This helps
catch errors at compile time rather than at runtime.

2. Code Reusability:
You can create generic classes and methods that work with any data type. This promotes code
reusability, reducing the need to duplicate code for different data types.

3. Elimination of Type Casting:
With generics, you can avoid the need for explicit type casting, making the code more concise
and readable.

### How Generics Work:
Generics use type parameters to represent the types of objects or values that a generic class,
interface, or method can work with. These type parameters are specific when using the generic
entity.

Here's a simple example of a generic class:
```
public class Box<T> {
    private T value;
    
    public void setValue(T value) {
        this.value = value;
    }
    
    public T getValue() {
        return value;
    }
}
```
In this example, `'T'` is a type parameter that can be replaced with any valid Java type when
creating an instance of the `'Box'` class.

### Introduction of Generics in Java:
Generics were introduced in Java 5 (JDK 5.0), which was released in 2004. Prior to Java 5,
collections and classes like `'ArrayList'` used raw types, leading to potential runtime
errors due to type mismatches. Generics addressed this issue and improved the overall type
safety of Java code.

### Example Usage:
```
// Using the generic class Box with Integer type parameter
Box<Integer> integerBox = new Box<>();
integerBox.setValue(42);
int value = integerBox.getValue(); // No casting needed, and it's type-safe
```

By embracing generics, you can create more flexible and reliable code in your Java projects.
Understanding how to use generics effectively will certainly contribute to your goal of
providing the best solutions as a Java developer in the fintech industry.
