# Compilation Process

When you compile your Java source code, it is translated into Java bytecode. The compilation
process involves a series of steps, and the compiler used can depend on the JDK version and
configuration. Here's an overview:

### Compilation Process:

1. Java Compiler (`'javac'`):
The first stage of compilation involves the Java Compiler (`'javac'`). This compiler takes your
java source code (`'.java'` files) and translates it into intermediate bytecode (`'.class'`
files). The bytecode is a platform-independent representation of your code.
```
javac YourJavaFile.java
```

2. Generated Bytecode
The generated bytecode is stored in `'.class'` files, which can then be executed on any
system with a compatible Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

### Determining the Compiler Used:

1. Compiler Version:
You can check the version of the Java Compiler using the following command:
```
javac -verison
```
This command will display the version of the Java Compiler installed on your system.

2. JIT Compilation (Just-In-Time Compilation):
The compilation process doesn't end with `'javac'`. When you run a Java program, the JVM uses
an additional compilation step known as JIT compilation. This happens at runtime and involves
translating the bytecode into native machine code for the specific platform. The JIT compiler
is part of the JVM and is responsible for optimizing and translating bytecode into native
instructions. The goal is to improve the performance of the Java application by compiling
frequently executed code paths.

### Difference and Relevance:

1. `'javac'` (Ahead-of-Time Compilation):
`'javac'` performs ahead-of-time compilation, translating Java source code to bytecode before
execution. This bytecode is platform-independent and can be executed on any system with a
compatible JVM.

2. JIT Compilation (Dynamic Compilation):
JIT Compilation happens at runtime. The JVM interprets the bytecode initially, and as the
program runs, it identifies hotspots - frequently executed code paths. The JIT compiler then
translates these hotspots into native machine code for better performance.

### When are they relevant?

1. `'javac'` (Ahead-of-Time Compilation):
Relevant during the development phase when you are preparing your Java application for
deployment. This step ensures that your Java source code is translated into bytecode that can
be executed on any JVM.

2. JIT Compilation (Dynamic Compilation):
Relevant during the execution of your Java application. The JIT compiler optimizes performance
by translating frequently executed bytecode into native machine code at runtime.

### Overall Benefits:

1. Ahead-of-Time Compilation (`'javac'`):
- Platform Independence: The generated bytecode can be executed on any system with a
compatible JVM.
- Simplifies distribution: You distribute the compiled bytecode, making your application
independent of the underlying architecture.

2. JIT Compilation (Dynamic Compilation):
- Performance optimization: Translates hotspots into native machine code, improving execution
speed.
- Adaptive optimization: The JIT compiler can adapt to the runtime behavior of the application,
applying optimizations as needed.

In summary, `'javac'` is responsible for ahead-of-time compilation, generating bytecode that
is platform-independent. The JIT compiler, on the other hand, dynamically compiles bytecode
into native machine code at runtime, providing performance improvements tailored to the
specific execution environment. Both compilation steps play crucial roles in the Java
application lifecycle.
