# Asynchronous Methods

In the context of asynchronous programming, when we say "the methods returns immediately", it
means that the method doesn't block the calling thread. Instead, it returns control to the
caller immediately after the asynchronous method is invoked.

Here's why this is beneficial:

1. Non-Blocking Behavior:
   - Asynchronous methods are designed to operate in a non-blocking manner. When you invoke
   an asynchronous method, it starts its execution but doesn't wait for the result. This
   allows the calling thread to continue with its work without being blocked.

2. Concurrency and Responsiveness:
   - In applications that handle many tasks concurrently, blocking the calling thread until
   a tasks completes could lead to reduced responsiveness and concurrency. By returning
   immediately, the calling thread can continue with other tasks or respond to user
   interactions.

3. Parallelism and Efficiency:
   - In scenarios where parallelism is essential, such as handling multiple requests
   concurrently, asynchronous methods allow for more efficient utilization of resources. The
   calling thread isn't tied up waiting for a potentially time-consuming operation to
   complete.

4. Handling Many Tasks Concurrently:
   - Imaging a scenario where a system needs to handle many tasks simultaneously. If each
   task involves some I/O operation (e.g., reading from a database or making a network call),
   using asynchronous methods allows the system to initiate multiple tasks without waiting
   for each to finish.

5. Better Resource Utilization:
   - Asynchronous programming is often associated with improved resource utilization. Instead
   of having threads waiting idly, the same threads can be used to initiate other tasks or
   handle additional requests.

Here's a simple example in Java using the `'CompletableFuture'` class:
```
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

public class AsyncExample {
    public static void main(String args) {
        // Asynchronous method
        CompletableFuture<Void> future = CompletableFuture.runAsync(() -> {
            // Asynchronous task
            System.out.println("Asynchronous task started");
            
            // Simulate time consuming operation
            try {
                Thread.sleep(2000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            
            System.out.prnitln("Asynchronous task completed");
        });
        
        // The main thread continues immediately without waiting for the asynchronous task
        // to finish
        System.out.println("Main thread continues with other work");
        
        // Wait for the asynchronous task to complete (this is optional)
        future.join();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `'CompletableFuture.runAsync'` method is used to execute a task
asynchronously. The main method thread continues with other work without waiting for the
asynchronous task to finish. This non-blocking behavior is a fundamental aspect of
asynchronous programming.
