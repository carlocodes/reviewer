# Spring Boot

Spring Boot is a framework developed by the Pivotal team (now part of
VMWare) that simplifies the process of building, deploying, and running
Java-based applications. It is designed to make it easier to create
stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications with minimal effort.

### Key aspects of Spring Boot:

1. Simplified Configuration:

- Spring Boot uses sensible default configurations to reduce the need for
manual setup. It employs convention over configuration principles,
minimizing the amount of code the configuration needed to get an application
up and running.

2. Embedded Web Server:

- Spring Boot comes with an embedded web server (Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow)
by default. This eliminates the need for external web servers, making it
convenient for deployment and testing.

3. Auto-Configuration:

- Spring Boot provides a vast set of default configurations for various
libraries and frameworks. It automatically configures the application based
on the dependencies present in the project, reducing the need for explicit
configurations.

4. Production-Ready Features:

- Spring Boot includes built-in features for production environments, such
as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration. This ensures
that applications built with Spring Boot are ready for deployment in a
production environment.

5. Spring Boot Starters:

- Spring Boot Starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that
simplify the inclusion of various dependencies in your project. They provide
a quick way to set up a project for specific use cases like web development,
data access, or messaging.

6. Microservices Support:

- Spring Boot is well-suited for building microservices architectures. It
simplifies the development of microservices by providing tools for service
discovery, configuration management, and load balancing.

7. Spring Ecosystem Integration:

- Spring Boot seamlessly integrates with the broader Spring ecosystem,
including Spring Data JPA for data access, Spring Security for security
aspects, and other Spring projects. This ensures a consistent and cohesive
development experience.

8. DevOps Friendliness:

- With its emphasis on convention over configuration and embedded servers,
Spring Boot aligns well with DevOps practices. It facilitates the deployment
and scaling of applications in containerized environments.

### Difference between Spring and Spring Boot

- Spring:
It is a comprehensive framework providing a wide range of functionalities for
enterprise Java development. It requires a lot of configuration and setup for
a new project.

- Spring Boot is a specialized framework built on top of the Spring framework
with a focus on simplifying and streamlining the development of production-ready
applications. It comes with defaults and conventions to reduce the need for
explicit configuration.

In summary, Spring Boot is used to simplify and accelerate the development of
production-ready Spring applications, offering features like simplified
configuration, embedded web servers, and production-ready defaults. It finds
applications in various domains, including web development, microservices, and
enterprise applications.
